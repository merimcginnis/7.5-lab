      <p class="text-lg text-white">
        During this lab assignment, I found that the GitHub Copilot in the GPT-4o model, was helpful primarily for gathering more information on the Javascript libraries. Howeer, the AI Copilot was unable to to fully understand the prompts that I provided when it came to design and styleing. This made it extremely difficult when trying to use tailwind.css for the first time. After looking at the code that was generated, I realize that it would have taken me a much longer time to hand type this information. Although I save time with the Copilot, when I tried going back to edit the code myself I struggled to look through it all.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gold">Deisigning, Other models and Examples</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-white">
        Like I mentioned above the use of a ChatBot for design purposes is very unhelpful. It was clear the AI does not know how to follow direction when it came to creating a design. The AI tended to suggest very basic styles, like adding p-4 or bg-gray-100, without considering spacing, responsiveness, or usability. In some cases, the designs it proposed were either too plain or awkwardly structured, which required me to change the code manually. Additionally, when I tried to use the other GPTs I was unable to recieve the same output. It was only allowing for a 'preview' use of the tool.</p>

            Here are some examples of the code that was generated by the AI Copilot:

            <details class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded">
              <summary class="text-lg font-medium text-gold cursor-pointer">Chat-GPT 4</summary>
              <p class="text-white mt-2">Prompt: "Can you edit the css style to look modern and clean with black and gold accents using tailwind"</p>
              <p class="text-white mt-2">Output: a full rewrite of the Tailwind.css and "This code updates the styles to use black and gold accents, providing a modern and clean look. The body, nav, and h1 strong elements have been updated to reflect these changes."</p> <br>
              <p class="text-white mt-2">Prompt: "edit the colors and make it look like it was designed from a professional artist"</p>
              <p class="text-white mt-2">Output: I was curious if the AI was able to replicate an artists style, but found that it is incapable of being creative. The out put was interesting because it did not chnage the look at all, only the color. "This approach leverages Tailwind CSS classes to style your HTML elements directly, providing a modern and professional look with black and gold accents."</p>
