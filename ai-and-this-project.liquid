      <p class="text-lg text-white">
        During this lab assignment, I found that the GitHub Copilot in the GPT-4o model, was helpful primarily for gathering more information on the Javascript libraries. Howeer, the AI Copilot was unable to to fully understand the prompts that I provided when it came to design and styleing. This made it extremely difficult when trying to use tailwind.css for the first time. After looking at the code that was generated, I realize that it would have taken me a much longer time to hand type this information. Although I save time with the Copilot, when I tried going back to edit the code myself I struggled to look through it all.
